Hugo's Science Project 2017.
Components:
Adafruit MCP3008 Anolouge to digital converter
Adafruit CharLCD LCD screen
Iduino pulse monitor
raspberry pi

What Happens:
when the heartrate monittor gets an input, it uses an algorithim to work out 
the BPM of the heartrate and uses that to show emoji on the screen, depending
On how you feel (eg. if your pulse gets above 100, then put an :| on the 
screen, etc)))

we need the analogue - digital converter because the pulse meter reads your 
heartrate as an analogue signal, so if we plug it staright in to the raspberry
pi, then it wont work.

Testing:
We started off with a calm reading, sitting calmly on the lounge, and the 
reading was 77 BPM then we wanted to simulate an excited reading, so
we jumped on the trampoline with two people an a giant frisbee, and we got a 
BPM of 117.
