Hugo's Science Project 2017.
Components:
Adafruit MCP3008 Anolouge to digital converter
Adafruit CharLCD LCD screen
Iduino pulse monitor
raspberry pi

What Happens:
when the heartrate monittor gets an input, it uses an algorithim to work out 
the BPM of the heartrate and uses that to show emoji on the screen, depending
On how you feel (eg. if your pulse gets above 100, then put an :| on the 
screen, etc)))

we need the analogue - digital converter because the pulse meter reads your 
heartrate as a anologe signal, so if we plug it staright in to the raspberry
pi, then it wont work.

We jumpend on the trampoline with two people an a giant frisbee, and we got a 
BPM of 117
